# Jenkins ECS Terraform Module


A containerized Jenkins Master implementation orchestrated by ECS.
- An EC2 Auto Scaling Group is created to ensure an ECS Host is available.
- A Jenkins Master ECS Service is created to keep Jenkins up and running, despite host failure or sudden unavailability.
- Persistence of jenkins_home is ensured with a reattachable EBS volume orchestrated by a docker plugin.
- Optionally, a snapshot of an existing jenkins_home volume may be passed to create a new Jenkins from existing Jenkins config.
- Jenkins Master is fronted with an Application Load Balancer performing TLS termination.
- A Data Lifecycle Management policy is created to automate the creation and lifecycle of jenkins_home EBS Snapshots.

## Terraform versions

Terraform 0.12 +


## Usage
See a common implementation (complete with VPC) [here!](examples/common)

Note:  Below, we are pinning our module source to release 2.2.2 as an example.  Pinning to a specific release is a good practice, as it helps prevent bringing in breaking changes unwittingly.  The version pinned below is not guaranteed to reflect the latest version, since this block may not be kept strictly up to date.  Check the releases for new versions!

```hcl
module "jenkins" {
  source                         = "git::https://github.com/collabralink-technology/quickstart-tech-challenge.git?ref=2.2.2"
  name                           = "jenkins"
  vpc_id                         = "vpc-abc123"
  host_instance_type             = "t3.large"
  auto_scaling_subnets           = ["subnet-123afb39d0dagdv32","subnet-004aff23j60dwez897"]
  auto_scaling_availability_zone = "us-east-1a"
  load_balancer_subnets          = ["subnet-277afb45g0dagdv32","subnet-3288vvssdwezf221xv"]
  fqdn                           = "jenkins.mydomain.com"
  fqdn_hosted_zone               = "mydomain.com"
  fqdn_certificate_arn           = "arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:02333354974:certificate/dsav3ea6-6ff5-31e8-93cc-8badfdvzf1345"
}

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| auto\_scaling\_availability\_zone | The single AZ into which Jenkins should be launched. | string | n/a | yes |
| auto\_scaling\_subnets | The subnets for the Jenkins auto scaling group into which Jenkins may be placed. | list | n/a | yes |
| fqdn | The FQDN with which jenkins is accessed; leave blank to simnply access Jenkins with the generated DNS name of the load balancer.  If set, fqdn_hosted_zone is required. | string | `""` | no |
| fqdn\_certificate\_arn | The arn of the ACM certificate that gets applied to jenkins ALB.  Setting this effectively enables SSL.  The certificate's domain must be valid for the set fqdn and fqdn_hosted_one.  If set, fqdn and fqdn_hosted_zone are required. | string | `""` | no |
| fqdn\_hosted\_zone | The hosted zone in which to create the route 53 record for jenkins.  The fqdn should fall inside this hosted zone.  If set, fqdn is required | string | `""` | no |
| host\_instance\_type | Jenkins master instance type | string | `"m5.xlarge"` | no |
| host\_key\_name | Name of an existing EC2 Key Pair to attach to the Jenkins Host. | string | `""` | no |
| host\_security\_groups | Additional security groups to add to the jenkins host.  Warning:  These will only take affect when the next EC2 instance is launched by autoscaling.  You may want to use the ecs_host_security_group_id output to attach a new rule externally. | list | `[]` | no |
| image | Jenkins image to use | string | `"jenkins/jenkins:lts-centos"` | no |
| jenkins\_home\_size | The size in GB for the jenkins_home volume.  If using with jenkins_home_snapshot_id, size must be greater than the snapshot size. | string | `"50"` | no |
| jenkins\_home\_snapshot\_id | The snapshot ID from which to build the ebs volume. | string | `""` | no |
| load\_balancer\_internal | Set to true to create a publicly-resolvable but non-publicly-accessible load balancer for jenkins.  If set to true, load_balancer_subnets must be given private subnets. | bool | `"false"` | no |
| load\_balancer\_subnets | The subnets the load balancer will include. | list | n/a | yes |
| name | Name for the Jenkins installation.  This is used in prefixes and suffixes. | string | n/a | yes |
| prefix | Prefix used in naming resources | string | `"jenkins"` | no |
| vpc\_id | VPC ID into which Jenkins is launched. | string | n/a | yes |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ecs\_cluster\_id | The ID of the ECS cluster. |
| ecs\_host\_role\_id | The IAM role ID attached to the ECS host instance.  This can be used to attach new policies to the ECS host. |
| ecs\_host\_security\_group\_id | The ID of the security group used by the Jenkins master launch config.  Note:  With awsvpc networking, the host network configuration does not control the task network configuration; to do that, see ecs_task_security_group_id. |
| ecs\_task\_private\_endpoint | The privately accessible FQDN for the task.  This can be used by Jenkins slaves to reach the master privately. |
| ecs\_task\_role\_id | The IAM role ID attached to the ECS task.  This can be used to attach new policies to the running task. |
| ecs\_task\_security\_group\_id | The ID of the security group attached to the Jenkins task. |
| jenkins\_url | Jenkins' URL.  Put this in a browser. |
